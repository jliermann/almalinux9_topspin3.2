## Introduction

With CentOS 7 reaching its [end of life](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#Life_Cycle_Dates) on June 30th, 2024, existing Bruker NMR workstations have to be migrated to a newer distribution. However, for TopSpin 3.2 (required for Avance II spectrometers), Bruker offers [no official support](https://repo-bbio.bruker.com/AlmaLinux/9/TopSpinInstallationRequirements.html). This manual provides guidance on how to setup an NMR workstation with TopSpin 3.2 using VirtualBox.
